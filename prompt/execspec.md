# ExecSpec (Agent Prompt)

You are working in a repository with an `AGENTS.md` contract.

## Output Requirements
- Keep changes minimal and scoped.
- Provide a final message with:
  - Summary (1-3 bullets)
  - Files changed (paths)
  - Verification commands (exact commands)

## Safety
- Do not rewrite unrelated code.
- If uncertain, ask before refactoring.
